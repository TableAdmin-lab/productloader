# ðŸš€How to Use the Product Loader

### **Step 1: Set Your Session Defaults**

Before you start adding products, you need to set up the defaults for your current session. This ensures consistency across all the products you add.

1. **Site**: Enter the name of your store or business location (e.g., "Main Street Cafe"). This is a required field.
2. **Define PLU/SKU?**: Choose how you want to assign Product PLU/SKUs.
    - **No (Auto-generate)**: The tool will automatically create a unique PLU for each product, starting from `PLU-1001`. This is the recommended option for simplicity.
    - **Yes (Manual Entry)**: You will be required to enter a unique PLU/SKU for each product. This is for users who have a pre-existing SKU system.
3. **Set Defaults**: Click this button to lock in these settings. You can click "Edit Defaults" later if you need to make changes.

### **Step 2: Fill in the Product Details**

Complete the main form with the details of your product. Required fields are marked with a blue asterisk (*).
